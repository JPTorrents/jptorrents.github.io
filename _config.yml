Welcome to Joel Perez-Torrents’ personal website, a hub for exploring my research endeavors. 
You’ll find information on my research projects and articles, insights and materials from my teachings, and briefs of my Substack posts.
This site is designed for professionals, students, researchers, and anyone interested in Human-AI collaboration, or the use of Artificial Intelligence, with ethnographic approaches in the contexte of the healthcare system, and pragmatist theorical lenses to look at it.
Discover more about my work and connect with me for collaboration and discussion.
